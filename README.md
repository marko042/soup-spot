         ## Features left to Implement
          - in the future we are planning to add more items to our menu, therefore we will have to expand the page.
          - We will aim to create more detailed menu section which would contain more information presented in a way that users find engaging.


 # Testing

          Testing was performed throughout the entire build. Using Firefox  developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.
          I've decided on Firefox because it is in my opinion more user friendly when it comes to breaking down grid and flexbox elements.

## Validator Testing

- HTML [ValidatorW3](https://validator.w3.org/)
    - Two errors were found, that do not affect the functionality or aesthetics of the page. The issue I had was making google map embedded iframe element to scale down and keep the aspect ratio. I found a solution on [Viostream](https://help.viostream.com/frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-make-an-iframe-embed-responsive/). After implementing the solution,  error I was getting is shown below. I decided to leave it.

- CSS [Jigsaw.W3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
    - The CSS validator did not find any errors in my CSS <p>
<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
    <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"

    - What does Lighthouse score mean?
A Google Lighthouse score is the rating Google gives your site based on a combination of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practice criteria in artificial conditions that mimic real ones. Site's are “graded” based on four buckets of criteria and rated 0 – 100. The higher the score out of 100, the better.
