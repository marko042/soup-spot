         ## Features left to Implement
          - in the future we are planning to add more items to our menu, therefore we will have to expand the page.
          - We will aim to create more detailed menu section which would contain more information presented in a way that users find engaging.


 # Testing

          Testing was performed throughout the entire build. Using Firefox  developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.
          I've decided on Firefox because it is in my opinion more user friendly when it comes to breaking down grid and flexbox elements.

## Validator Testing

- HTML
    - Two errors were found, that do not affect the functionality of the page. The issue I had was making google map embedded iframe element to scale down and keep the aspect ratio. I found a solution on [Viostream](https://help.viostream.com/frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-make-an-iframe-embed-responsive/). After implementing the solution,  error I was getting is shown below. I decided to leave it.
